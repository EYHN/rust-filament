# filament-bindings

This package provides build scripts and prebuilt binaries for [Google/filament](https://github.com/google/filament) on Windows, macOS, Linux, and the unsafe binding interface automatically generated by [rust-bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen).

## Prebuilt Binaries

Because filament builds are very slow and have build environment requirements. We provide prebuilt binaries for common platforms and features.

When a new version is released, github action automatically runs pre-build tasks, and all prebuilt binaries are saved in [filament-binaries/releases](https://github.com/EYHN/filament-binaries/releases).

The `filament-binding` build script will try to download the prebuilt binaries from github first, and skip the full source build.

We currently provide pre-built binary packages for `Windows`, `Linux`, `macOS`, and enable `OpenGL`, `Vulkan` backend for all platforms and `Metal` backend for macOS. For other platforms such as `Android`, `iOS` and `WASM` support is planned but not yet available.
